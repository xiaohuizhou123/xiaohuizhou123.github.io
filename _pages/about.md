I am currently an Assistant Research Scientist at the [Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center at the University of Maryland, College Park](https://essic.umd.edu/), working in collaboration with [NASA-Goddard's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO)](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/). I hold a Ph.D. from the [Graduate School of Oceanography at the University of Rhode Island](https://web.uri.edu/gso/) and have conducted postdoctoral research with [the High Meadows Environmental Institute at Princeton University](https://ua.princeton.edu/fields-study/councils-centers-and-institutes/high-meadows-environmental-institute).

My research focuses on the dynamics of air-sea interactions, with particular emphasis on how small-scale surface waves affect the exchange of momentum and trace gases between the atmosphere and ocean. I integrate numerical simulations, in-situ observations, and theoretical models to deepen our understanding of these processes. In addition to the air-sea interface, I am interested in how waves impact the atmospheric boundary layer near the ocean surface and influence upper ocean dynamics.

Technically, I develop coupled air-wave-ocean models to advance these investigations. I am also passionate about forecasting extreme weather events, including hurricanes, typhoons, and storm surges. My overarching goal is to enhance both short-term weather forecasting and long-term climate modeling by incorporating small-scale wave dynamics into Earth system models.
  
Outside of the lab, I enjoy playing tennis, swimming and hiking.

Currently I work as assistant research scientist at [Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center, University of Maryland,College Park](https://essic.umd.edu/), associated with [GMAO/NASA-Goddard](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/). I graduted from [Graduate School of Oceanography at University of Rhode Island](https://web.uri.edu/gso/),then I joined [HMEI at Princeton University](https://ua.princeton.edu/fields-study/councils-centers-and-institutes/high-meadows-environmental-institute). I integrates numerical simulations, in-situ data and theories to understand how the small-scale surface waves influence air-sea interactions, especially for momentum, trace gas transport between atomosphere and ocean. In addition to air-sea interface, I am also interested on the influence from waves on bottom atomosphere boundary layer and upper ocean layer dynamics. Technically, I develope coupled air-wave-ocean models to advance my research. I am also fascinated by extreme weather forecasting, such as hurricanes/typhoons and storm surge. My goal is improving both short-term weathere forecasting system and long-term climate model predictions by implementing the small-scale wave dynamics in the Earth system.
  
Outside of the lab, I enjoy playing tennis, swimming and hiking.

Currently I work as assistant research scientist at [Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center, University of Maryland,College Park](https://essic.umd.edu/), associated with [GMAO/NASA-Goddard](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/). I graduted from [Graduate School of Oceanography at University of Rhode Island](https://web.uri.edu/gso/),then I joined [HMEI at Princeton University](https://ua.princeton.edu/fields-study/councils-centers-and-institutes/high-meadows-environmental-institute). I integrates numerical simulations, in-situ data and theories to understand how the small-scale surface waves influence air-sea interactions, especially for momentum, trace gas transport between atomosphere and ocean. In addition to air-sea interface, I am also interested on the influence from waves on bottom atomosphere boundary layer and upper ocean layer dynamics. Technically, I develope coupled air-wave-ocean models to advance my research. I am also fascinated by extreme weather forecasting, such as hurricanes/typhoons and storm surge. My goal is improving both short-term weathere forecasting system and long-term climate model predictions by implementing the small-scale wave dynamics in the Earth system.
  
Outside of the lab, I enjoy playing tennis, swimming and hiking.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
